# NB: *.lock files are included, following the principles of Cargo keeping Cargo.lock files:
# by keeping the lock file associated with the build, a snapshot can easily be created showing
# what was going on at the moment of the build.  This prevents the need for guessing the environment
# that existed during the build, and makes it easier to assess whether this particular build will
# be suited for a particular end-user system.
